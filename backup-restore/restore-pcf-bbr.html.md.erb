title: Restoring PCF from Backup with BBR
owner: RelEng
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the procedure for restoring your critical backend Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) components with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR), a command-line tool for backing up and restoring BOSH deployments. To perform the procedures in this topic, you must have backed up PCF by following the steps in the [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](backup-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

To view the BBR release notes, see [BOSH Backup and Restore Release Notes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bbr/bbr-rn.html).

The procedures described in this topic prepare your environment for PCF, deploy Ops Manager, import your installation settings, and use BBR to restore your PCF components.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Restoring PCF with BBR is a destructive operation. If the restore fails, the new environment may be left in an unusable state and require re-provisioning. Only perform the procedures in this topic for the purpose of disaster recovery, such as recreating PCF after a storage-area network (SAN) corruption.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> When validating your backup, the VMs and disks from the backed-up BOSH Director should not visible to the new BOSH Director. As a result, Pivotal recommends that you deploy the new BOSH Director to a different IaaS network and account than the VMs and disks of the backed up BOSH Director.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> For PCF v2.0, BBR only supports backup and restore of environments with zero or one CredHub instances.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the BOSH Director you are restoring had any deployments that were deployed manually rather than through an Ops Manager tile, you must restore them manually at the end of the process. For more information, see <a href="#non-tiles">(Optional) Step 14: Restore Non-Tile Deployments</a>.</p>


## <a id="compatibility"></a> Compatibility of Restore

This section describes the restrictions for a backup artifact to be restorable to another environment.
This section is for guidance only, and Pivotal highly recommends that operators validate their backups by using the backup artifacts in a restore.

Consult the following restrictions for a backup artifact to be restorable:

+ **CIDR ranges**: BBR requires the IP address ranges to be the same in the restore environment as in the backup environment.
+ **Topology**: BBR requires the BOSH topology of a deployment to be the same in the restore environment as it was in the backup environment.
+ **Naming of instance groups and jobs**: For any deployment that implements the backup and restore scripts, the instance groups and jobs must have the same names.
+ **Number of instance groups and jobs**: For instance groups and jobs that have backup and restore scripts, there must be the same number of instances.
+ **Limited validation**: BBR puts the backed up data into the corresponding instance groups and jobs in the restored environment,
    but canâ€™t validate the restore beyond that.
    For example, if the MySQL encryption key is different in the restore environment,
    the BBR restore might succeed although the restored MySQL database is unusable.
+ **PCF version**: BBR can restore to the same version of PCF that was backed up. BBR does not support restoring to other major, minor, or patch releases.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> A change in VM size or underlying hardware should not affect BBR's ability to restore data, as long as there is adequate storage space to restore the data.</p>

The diagram above shows the flow of the PCF restore process in a series of steps performed by the PCF operator. The following steps will be covered in more detail throughout this topic.

1. **Launch new Ops Manager:** Perform the procedures for your IaaS to deploy Ops Manager. See part one of the [Deploy Ops Manager and Import Installation Settings](#deploy-import) step below for more information.

1. **Import settings:**  You can import settings either with the Ops Manager UI or API. See part two of the [Deploy Ops Manager and Import Installation Settings](#deploy-import) step below for more information.

1. **Remove bosh-state.json:** SSH into your Ops Manager VM and delete the `bosh-state.json` file. See the [Remove BOSH State File](#bosh-state) step below for more information.

1. **Apply Changes (Director only):** Use the Ops Manager API to only deploy the BOSH Director. See the [Deploy the BOSH Director](#bosh-only-deploy) step below for more information.

1. **bbr restore &lt;director&gt;:** Run the BBR restore command from your jumpbox to restore the BOSH Director. See the [Restore the BOSH Director](#restore-bosh) step below for more information.

1. **Use BOSH cck to fix the stale cloud ID references in the BOSH database:** For each deployment in the BOSH Director, you will need to run a `bosh cloud-check` command. See the [Remove Stale Cloud IDs for All Deployments](#bosh-cck) step for more information.

1. **Apply Changes:** On the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click **Review Pending Changes**, review your changes, and then click **Apply Changes**. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](../review-pending-changes.html).

1. **bbr restore &lt;PAS&gt;:** Run the BBR restore command from your jumpbox to restore PAS. See the [Restore PAS](#restore-ert) step below for more information.

##<a id='prepare-restore'></a> Prepare to Restore

This section provides the steps you need to perform before restoring your PCF backup with BBR.

### <a id='prepare-env'></a> Step 1: (Optional) Prepare Your Environment

In an event of a disaster, you may lose not only your VMs and disks, but your IaaS resources as well, such as networks and load balancers.

If you need to recreate your IaaS resources, prepare your environment for PCF by following the instructions specific to your IaaS in [Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../../installing/index.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The instructions for installing PCF on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and OpenStack combine the procedures for preparing your environment and deploying Ops Manager into a single topic. The instructions for the other supported IaaSes split these procedures into two separate topics.</p>

If you recreate your IaaS resources, you must also add those resources to Ops Manager by performing the procedures in the [Step 3: (Optional) Configure Ops Manager for New Resources](#config-new-resources) section.

### <a id='deploy-import'></a>Step 2: Deploy Ops Manager and Import Installation Settings ##

1. Perform the procedures for your IaaS to deploy Ops Manager:
    * **AWS**:
        * If you configured AWS manually, see _Step 12: Launch an Ops Manager API_ through _Step 19: Create a MySQL Database Using AWS RDS_ of [Installing PCF on AWS Manually](../../om/aws/prepare-env-manual.html#pcfaws-om-ami).
        * If you used Terraform to install PCF on AWS, see [Installing PCF on AWS Using Terraform](../aws-terraform.html).
    * **GCP**: See [Deploying Ops Manager on GCP Manually](../../om/gcp/deploy-manual.html).
    * **OpenStack**: See _Step 4: Create Ops Manager Image_ through _Step 9: Create a DNS Entry_ in [Deploying Ops Manager to OpenStack](../../om/openstack/setup.html#create-om-image).
    * **vSphere**: See [Deploying Ops Manager on vSphere](../../om/vsphere/deploy.html).

1. Import your installation settings. This can be done in two ways:

    1. Using the Ops Manager UI

        1. Access your new Ops Manager by navigating to `YOUR-OPS-MAN-FQDN` in a browser.

        1. On the **Welcome to Ops Manager** page, click **Import Existing Installation**.

            <%= image_tag("../images/upgrading/welcome.png") %>

        1. In the import panel, perform the following tasks:
          * Enter the **Decryption Passphrase** in use when you exported the installation settings from Ops Manager.
          * Click **Choose File** and browse to the installation zip file that you exported in the <a href='./backup-pcf-bbr.html#export'>Step 7: Export Installation Settings</a> section of the <em>Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR</em> topic.

            <%= image_tag("../images/upgrading/decryption_passphrase.png") %>

        1. Click **Import**.
            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the import process, and may appear to hang. The import process takes at least 10 minutes, and takes longer the more tiles that were present on the backed-up Ops Manager.</p>

        1. A **Successfully imported installation** message appears upon completion.

            <%= image_tag("../images/upgrading/success.png") %>

    1. Using the Ops Manager API:

        ```
        curl OPSMAN-URL/api/v1/installation_asset_collection \
          -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
          -F 'installation[file]=@installation.zip' \
          -F 'passphrase=DECRYPTION-PASSPHRASE'
        ```

        Where:
        - `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is the UAA access token. For more information about how to retrieve this token, see [Using the Ops Manager API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html).
        - `DECRYPTION-PASSPHRASE` is the decryption passphrase in use when you exported the installation settings from Ops Manager.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not click <strong>Apply Changes</strong> in Ops Manager until the instruction in Step 11: Redeploy PAS.</p>

### <a id="config-new-resources"></a> Step 3: (Optional) Configure Ops Manager for New Resources

If you recreated IaaS resources such as networks and load balancers by following the steps in the [Step 1: (Optional) Prepare Your Environment](#prepare-env) section above, perform the following steps to update Ops Manager with your new resources:

1. Enable Ops Manager advanced mode. For more information, see [How to Enable Advanced Mode in the Ops Manager](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In advanced mode Ops Manager will allow you to make changes that are normally disabled. You may see warning messages when you save changes.</p>

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click the BOSH Director tile.

1. If you are using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), click **Google Config** and update:
    1. **Project ID** to reflect the GCP project ID.
    1. **Default Deployment Tag** to reflect the environment name.
    1. **AuthJSON** to reflect the service account.

1. Click **Create Networks** and update the network names to reflect the network names for the new environment.

1. If your BOSH Director had an external hostname, you should change it in **Director Config > Director Hostname** to ensure it does not conflict with the hostname of the backed up Director.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile.

1. Click **Resource Config**. If necessary for your IaaS, enter the name of your new load balancers in the **Load Balancers** column.

1. If necessary, click **Networking** and update the load balancer SSL certificate and private key under **Certificates and Private Keys for HAProxy and Router**.

1. If your environment has a new DNS address, update the old environment DNS entries to point to the new load balancer addresses. For more information, see the [Step 4: Configure Networking](../custom-load-balancer.html#configure-networking) section of the _Using Your Own Load Balancer_ topic and follow the link to the instructions for your IaaS.

1. If your PAS uses an external blobstore, ensure that the PAS tile is configured to use a different blobstore, otherwise it will attempt to connect to the blobstore that the backed up PAS is using.

1. Ensure your **System Domain** and **Apps Domain** under PAS **Domains** are updated to refer to the new environment's domains.

1. Ensure that there are no outstanding warning messages in the BOSH Director tile, then disable Ops Manager advanced mode. For more information, see [How to Enable Advanced Mode in the Ops Manager](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Enable-Advanced-Mode-in-the-Ops-Manager) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.

### <a id="bosh-state"></a> Step 4: Remove BOSH State File

1. SSH into your Ops Manager VM. For more information, see the [SSH into Ops Manager](../trouble-advanced.html#ssh) section of the _Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI_ topic.

1. On the Ops Manager VM, delete the `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/bosh-state.json` file:
    
    ```
    sudo rm /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/bosh-state.json
    ```

1. Navigate to `YOUR-OPS-MAN-FQDN` in a browser and log into Ops Manager.

### <a id="bosh-only-deploy"></a> Step 5: Deploy the BOSH Director

Use the Ops Manager API or the checkbox on the Review Pending Changes page to deploy the BOSH Director by itself.

### <a id="artifacts-jumpbox"></a> Step 6: Transfer Artifacts to Jumpbox

In the [Step 9: Back Up Your PAS Deployment](./backup-pcf-bbr.html#bbr-backup) section of the _Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR_ topic, in the _After Taking the Backups_ section you moved the TAR and metadata files of the backup artifacts off your jumpbox to your preferred storage space. Now you must transfer those files back to your jumpbox.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal recommends that you regularly update the BBR binary on your jumpbox to the latest version</a>. See <a href="system-setup-bbr.html#scp">Transfer BBR Binary to Your Jumpbox</a> in <em>Setting Up Your Jumpbox for BBR</em> for more information.</p>

### <a id="retrieve"></a> Step 7: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials

Perform the following steps to retrieve the IP address of your BOSH Director and the credentials for logging in from the BOSH Director tile:

<%= partial 'bosh_target_director_bbr' %>

## <a id='restore'></a> Restore Your Backup

This section provides the steps you need to perform to restore your PCF backup with BBR.

### <a id='restore-bosh'></a> Step 8: Restore the BOSH Director

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The BBR BOSH Director restore command can take at least 15 minutes to complete.</li>
    <li>Pivotal recommends that you run it independently of the SSH session, so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code> but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the BOSH Director tile.

1. Click the **Credentials** tab.

1. Locate **Bbr Ssh Credentials** and click **Link to Credential** next to it.
<br><br>
    You can also retrieve the credentials using the Ops Manager API with a GET request to the following endpoint: `/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/bbr_ssh_credentials`. For more information, see the [Using the Ops Manager API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html) topic.

1. Copy the value for `private_key_pem`.

1. SSH into your jumpbox.

1. Run the following command to reformat the key and save it to a file named `PRIVATE-KEY` in the current directory, copying in the contents of your private key for `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY`:
  
    ```
    printf -- "YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY" > PRIVATE-KEY
    ```

1. Ensure the BOSH Director backup artifact is in the folder you from which you will run BBR.

1. Run the BBR restore command from your jumpbox to restore the BOSH Director:
  
    ```
    bbr director \
    --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY \
    --username bbr \
    --host HOST \
    restore \
    --artifact-path PATH-TO-DIRECTOR-BACKUP
    ```
    Where:
    <br>
    * `PATH-TO-DIRECTOR-BACKUP` is the path to the Director backup you want to restore.
    * `PRIVATE-KEY`is the path to the private key file you created above.
    * `HOST`is the address of the BOSH Director. 
      * If the BOSH Director is public, this is a URL, such as `https://my-bosh.xxx.cf-app.com`. 
      * If the BOSH Director is not public, it is the `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` retrieved 
      in [Step 7: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve).
    * Use the optional `--debug` flag if you want to enable debug logs. 
    See the [Logging](backup-pcf-bbr.html#logging) section of the _Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR_ topic for more information.

1. If the command succeeds, continue to [Step 9: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
<br><br>
If the command fails, do the following:
  1. Run the BBR restore-cleanup command:

        ```
        bbr director \
        --private-key-path PRIVATE-KEY \
        --username bbr \
        --host HOST \
        restore-cleanup
        ```
  1. Run the BBR restore command again after checking the following:
  <br><br>
      * All the parameters in the command are set.
      * The BOSH Director credentials are valid.
      * The specified deployment exists.
      * The source deployment is compatible with the target deployment.
      * That the jumpbox can reach the BOSH Director.


### <a id='identify-deployment'></a> Step 9: Identify Your Deployment

After logging in to your BOSH Director, run `bosh deployments` to identify the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments

Name                     Release(s)
cf-example               push-apps-manager-release/661.1.24
                         cf-backup-and-restore/0.0.1
                         binary-buildpack/1.0.11
                         capi/1.28.0
                         cf-autoscaling/91
                         cf-mysql/35
                         ...
</pre>

In the above example, the name of the BOSH deployment that contains PCF is `cf-example`. `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director. For more information, see [Ensure BOSH Director Certificate Availability](./system-setup-bbr.html#root-ca-cert).


### <a id="bosh-cck"></a> Step 10: Remove Stale Cloud IDs for All Deployments

For every deployment in the BOSH Director, run the following command:

```
bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
--ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
-d DEPLOYMENT-NAME -n cck \
--resolution delete_disk_reference \
--resolution delete_vm_reference
```

This reconciles the BOSH Director's internal state with the state in the IaaS. You can use the list of deployments returned in [Step 9: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).

If the `bosh cloud-check` command does not successfully delete disk references and you see a message similar to the following, perform the additional procedures in the [Remove Unused Disks](#removing-disks) section below.
<pre class="terminal">
Scanning 19 persistent disks: 19 OK, 0 missing ...
</pre>


### <a id='redeploy-ert'></a> Step 11: Redeploy PAS

1. Perform the following steps to determine which stemcell is used by PAS:
  1. Go to **Stemcell Library**.
  1. Record the PAS stemcell release number from the **Staged** column. For more information about stemcells in Ops Manager, see [Importing and Managing Stemcells](../../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html).
    <br><br>
    You can also retrieve the stemcell release using the BOSH CLI:
      <pre class="terminal">
        $ bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP deployments
        Using environment '10.0.0.5' as user 'director' (bosh.\*.read, openid, bosh.\*.admin, bosh.read, bosh.admin)

        Name                     Release(s)                            Stemcell(s)                                    Team(s)  Cloud Config
        cf-9cb6995b7d746cd77438  push-apps-manager-release/661.1.24    bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent/3421.9  -        latest
        ...
      </pre>

1. Download the stemcell from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells).

1. Run the following command to upload the stemcell used by PAS:
  
    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    <%= vars.bosh_upload_stemcell %> \
    --fix PATH-TO-STEMCELL
    ```

1. If you have any other tiles installed, ensure you upload their stemcells if they are different from the PAS stemcell. Upload stemcells to the BOSH Director with `bosh <%= vars.bosh_upload_stemcell %> --fix PATH-TO-STEMCELL`, as in the command above.

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, navigate to PAS **Resource Config**.

1. Ensure the number of instances for MySQL Server is set to `1`.
  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Restore will fail if there is not exactly one MySQL Server instance deployed.</p>

1. Ensure that all errands needed by your system are set to run.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Review your changes. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](../review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes** to redeploy.


### <a id='restore-services'></a> Step 12: (Optional) Restore Service Data

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> BBR does not back up or restore any service data.</p>

For this step, restore data to pre-provisioned service tiles.

The procedures for restoring service data vary. Consult the documentation for your service tile for more information.

For example, if you are using Redis for PCF v1.14, see [Using BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR)](https://docs.pivotal.io/redis/1-14/bbr-backup.html).

### <a id='restore-ert'></a> Step 13: Restore PAS

<div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The BBR PAS restore command can take at least 15 minutes to complete.</li>
    <li>Pivotal recommends that you run it independently of the SSH session, so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code> but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

1. Refer to the table in [Enabling External Blobstore Backups](enabling-external-blobstore-backups.html#blobstore-support). If external blobstore support is not included in the version of Ops Manager and PAS you are using, restore the external blobstore with your IaaS-specific tools before restoring PAS.

1. Run the BBR restore command from your jumpbox to restore PAS:

    ```
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --password BOSH-PASSWORD \
    --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    restore \
    --artifact-path PATH-TO-PAS-BACKUP
    ```

    Where:
    <br>
    * `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the BOSH Director IP retrieved in
    [Step 7: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve).
    <br><br>
    * `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-PASSWORD` are the BOSH UAA credentials.
    <br><br>
    To retrieve these credentials, navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, 
    click **BOSH Director**, navigate to the **Credentials** tab, and click **Uaa Bbr Client Credentials**.
    <br><br>
    You can also retrieve the credentials using the Ops Manager API with a GET
    request to the following endpoint: `/api/v0/deployed/director/credentials/uaa_bbr_client_credentials`.
    <br>
    For more information, see [Using the Ops Manager API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html).
    <br><br>
    * `DEPLOYMENT-NAME` is the deployment name retrieved in 
    [Step 9: Identify Your Deployment](#identify-deployment).
    <br><br>
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE` is the path to the Certificate Authority 
    (CA) certificate for the BOSH Director, if the certificate is not verifiable
    by the local machineâ€™s certificate chain.
    * `PATH-TO-PAS-BACKUP` is the path to the PAS backup you want to restore.

    1. If desired, scale the MySQL Server job back up to its previous number of instances by navigating to the **Resource Config** section of the PAS tile. After scaling the job, return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
    
    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

    1. Review your changes. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](../review-pending-changes.html).

    1. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy.


### <a id='odb'></a> Step 14: (Optional) Restore On-Demand Service Instances

If you have on-demand service instances provisioned by an on-demand service broker, perform the following steps to restore them after successfully restoring PAS:

1. Navigate to an on-demand service tile in the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Select the **Errands** tab.

1. Ensure the **Upgrade All Service Instances** errand is **On**.

1. Repeat for all on-demand service tiles.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, review your changes, and then click **Apply Changes**. For more information, see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](../review-pending-changes.html). This will include running the Upgrade All Service Instances errand for the on-demand service, which will redeploy the on-demand service instances.

1. (Optional) Restore service data to every on-demand service instance.

1. Any app on PAS bound to an on-demand service instance may need to be restarted to start consuming the restored on-demand service instances.


### <a id='non-tiles'></a> Step 15: (Optional) Restore Non-Tile Deployments

If you have any deployments that were deployed manually with the BOSH Director rather than through an Ops Manager tile, perform the following steps to restore the VMs.

1. Identify the names of the deployments that you need to restore. Do not include the deployments from Ops Manager tiles. Run the following command to obtain a list of all deployments on your BOSH Director:
  
    ``` 
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    deployments
    ```

1. Run the following command for each deployment you need to restore:
  
    ```
    bosh -n -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    cck --resolution=recreate_vm
    ```

1. Run the following command to verify the status of the VMs in each deployment:
    
    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    vms
    ```
  The process state for all VMs should show as `running`.

## <a id="after-restore"></a> After Restoring Your Backup

This section provides the steps you need to perform after restoring your PCF backup with BBR.

### <a id='removing-disks'></a> Step 16: Remove Unused Disks

If `bosh cloud-check` does not clean up all disk references, you must manually delete the disks from a previous deployment that will prevent recreated deployments from working.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> This is a very destructive operation.</p>

To delete the disks, perform one of the following procedures:

* Use the BOSH CLI to delete the disks by performing the following steps:
  1. Target the redeployed BOSH Director using the BOSH CLI by performing the procedures in [Step 7: Retrieve BOSH Director Address and Credentials](#retrieve).
  1. List the deployments by running the following command:
    
        ```
        bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
        --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE deployments
        ```
  1. Delete each deployment with the following command:
    
        ```
        bosh -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME <%= vars.bosh_delete_deployment %>
        ```
* Log in to your IaaS account and delete the disks manually. Run the following command to retrieve a list of disk IDs:
  
    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE instances -i
    ```

Once the disks are deleted, continue with [Step 10: Remove Stale Cloud IDs for All Deployments](#bosh-cck).
