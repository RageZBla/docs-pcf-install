When you deploy [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you provision a set of resources. This topic describes how to delete the resources associated with a PCF deployment. 

You can delete the resources in one of two ways:

  * If you created a separate project for your PCF deployment, perform the procedure in the [Delete the Project](#delete-project) delete the project.
  * If the project that contains your PCF deployment also contains other resources that you want to preserve, perform the procedure in the [Delete PCF Resources](#delete-resources) section.
