This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on vSphere. 

If you experience a problem while following the steps below, refer to the [Known Issues](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/pcf-release-notes/index.html) topics or to [Diagnosing Problems in PCF](./diagnostics.html).

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Requirements

This section describes the resource requirements for installing PCF. 

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using the Cisco Nexus 1000v Switch, refer to the <a href="nexus-switch.html">Using the Cisco Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager</a> topic for more information.</p>

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> When installing Ops Manager on a vSphere environment with multiple ESXi hosts, you must use network-attached or shared storage devices. Local storage devices do not support sharing across multiple ESXi hosts.</p>

### <a id='runtimes'></a> Resource Requirements 

You can install PCF with one of two runtimes. For more information about the requirements for each runtime, see the following:

* **Pivotal Application Service (PAS)**: [PAS on vSphere Requirements](./pas-vsphere-requirements.html). For information requirements when deploying with NSX-T, see the _Requirements_ section of [Deploying PAS with NSX-T Networking](./vsphere-nsx-t.html). 
* **Pivotal Container Service (PKS)**: 
    * **Without NSX-T**: [vSphere Prerequisites and Resource Requirements](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/vsphere-requirements.html)
    * **With NSX-T**: See the _Preparing to Install PKS on vSphere with NSX-T_ section of [Installing PKS on vSphere with NSX-T Data Center](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/vsphere-nsxt-index.html). 

### <a id='permissions'></a> vSphere Service Account Requirements

Ops Manager requires read/write permissions to the data center level of the [vSphere Inventory Hierarchy](http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-4-esx-vcenter/index.jsp?topic=/com.vmware.vsphere.dcadmin.doc_41/vsp_dc_admin_guide/managing_users_groups_roles_and_permissions/c_hierarchical_inheritance_of_permissions.html) to successfully install. Pivotal recommends defining a custom role for the service account that has all privileges for all objects in the data center, including propagating privileges to children.

Since Ops Manager passes all required credentials through to BOSH, you only need one service account with the required vSphere privileges to complete the installation. Setting up separate service accounts for Ops Manager and BOSH is not necessary or recommended.

For more information about service account requirements, see the following topics:

* **PAS**: [vSphere Service Account Requirements](../om/vsphere/vsphere-service-account.html) 
* **PKS**: _Create the BOSH/Ops Manager Service Account_ section of [Preparing vSphere Before Deploying PKS](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/vsphere-prepare-env.html#create-bosh-ops-man) 

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also apply the default <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/topic/com.vmware.wssdk.pg.doc/PG_Appx_Privileges_Reference.22.4.html">VMware Administrator System Role</a> to the service account to achieve the appropriate permission level.</p>

### <a id="security"></a> vSphere Security Documents

* [vSphere Security guide (PDF)](http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/vsphere-esxi-vcenter-server-65-security-guide.pdf)<br />
This guide contains best practices for securing and managing a vSphere installation.
