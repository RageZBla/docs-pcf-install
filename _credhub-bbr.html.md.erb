In Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), you can back up CredHub and its data with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR). For more information, see [Backing Up and Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../customizing/backup-restore/index.html).

Ensure you also back up your encryption key. If you do not back up your encryption key, you cannot restore your BBR backups. For more information, see [Back Up the Encryption Keys](#encryption-keys).
