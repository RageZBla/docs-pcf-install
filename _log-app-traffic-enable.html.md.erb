* For **Denied logging interval**, set the per-second rate limit for packets blocked by either a container-specific networking policy or by App Security Group (ASG) rules applied across the space, org, or deployment. This field defaults to `1`. For more information, see the [Policies](../concepts/understand-cf-networking.html#policies) section of the _Container-to-Container Networking_ topic and [Restricting App Access to Internal PCF Components](../opsguide/app-sec-groups.html).
* For **UDP logging interval**, set the per-second rate limit for UDP packets sent and received. This field defaults to `100`.
* To enable logging for app traffic, select **Log traffic for all accepted/denied application packets**. This increases log volume. For more information, see the [App Traffic Logging](../opsguide/logging-config-opsman.html#app-traffic-log) section of the _Configuring Logging in PAS_ topic.
