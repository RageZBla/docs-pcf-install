(Optional) TCP Routing is disabled by default. You should enable this feature if your DNS sends TCP traffic through a load balancer rather than directly to a TCP router. To enable TCP routing:

   1. Select **Enable TCP Routing**.
   	<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you have mutual TLS app identity verification enabled, app containers accept incoming communication only from the Gorouter. This disables TCP routing.</p>
   1. For **TCP Routing Ports**, enter a single port or a range of ports for the load balancer to forward to. These are the same ports that you configured in the [Pre-Deployment Steps](../adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html) of the _Enabling TCP Routing_ topic.
     - To support multiple TCP routes, Pivotal recommends allocating multiple ports.
     - To allocate a list of ports rather than a range:
         1. Enter a single port in the **TCP Routing Ports** field.
         2. After deploying PAS, follow the directions in the [Configuring a List of TCP Routing Ports](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#tcp-port-config) section of the _Pivotal Application Service v2.3 Release Notes_ to add TCP routing ports using the cf CLI to add TCP routing ports using the cf CLI.
   1. For **TCP request timeout**, you can optionally modify the default value of 300 seconds. This field determines when the TCP Router closes idle connections from clients to apps that use TCP routes. You may want to increase this value to enable developers to push apps that require long-running idle connections with clients. 
   1. Ensure that you follow the additional instructions based on your IaaS:

	   		<td>GCP</td>
	   		<td>Specify the name of a GCP TCP load balancer in the <strong>LOAD BALANCER</strong> column of the TCP Router job in the <strong>Resource Config</strong> pane. You configure this later on in PAS. For more information, see <a href="#resources">Configure Resources</a>.</td>

These are the same IP addresses you configured your load balancer with in the <a href="../adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html#pre-deploy">Pre-Deployment Steps</a> section of the _Enabling TCP Routing_ topic, unless you configured DNS to resolve the TCP domain name directly to an IP you have chosen for the TCP router.</li>
