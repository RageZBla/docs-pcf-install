	1. (Optional) **Enter a Max Age in Seconds** for the HSTS request. By default, the age is set to one year. HAProxy will force HTTPS requests from browsers for the duration of this setting.
	1. (Optional) Select the **Include Subdomains** checkbox to force browsers to use HTTPS requests for all component subdomains.
	1. (Optional) Select the **Enable Preload** checkbox to force instances of Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that access your HAProxy to refer to their built-in lists of known hosts that require HTTPS, of which HAProxy is one. This ensures that the first contact a browser has with your HAProxy is an HTTPS request, even if the browser has not yet received an HSTS header from HAProxy.
