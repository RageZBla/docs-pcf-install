In the **Cloud Controller** pane, you configure the Cloud Controller.

To configure the **Cloud Controller** pane:

1. Select **Cloud Controller**.

1. Enter your **Cloud Controller DB Encryption Key** if all of the following are true:
  * You deployed PAS previously.
  * You then stopped PAS or it crashed.
  * You are re-deploying PAS with a backup of your Cloud Controller database.

  See [Backing Up and Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](./backup-restore/index.html) for more information.

1. **CF API Rate Limiting** prevents API consumers from overwhelming the platform API servers. Limits are imposed on a per-user or per-client basis and reset on an hourly interval. 
	<br><br>
	To disable Cloud Foundry API rate limiting, select **Disable** under **Enable CF API Rate Limiting**. To enable Cloud Foundry API rate limiting:
	1. Under **Enable CF API Rate Limiting**, select **Enable**.
	1. For **General Limit**, enter the number of requests a user or client is allowed to make over an hour-long interval for all endpoints that do not have a custom limit. The default value is `2000`.
	1. For **Unauthenticated Limit**, enter the number of requests an unauthenticated client is allowed to make over an hour-long interval. The default value is `100`.

1. (Optional) Enter in seconds your **Database Connection Validation Timeout**. By default, the setting is `3600` seconds or 60 minutes. You can enter `-1` to cause Cloud Controller to make an additional query to the database whenever connections are checked out from the pool. Choosing `-1` has performance implications.

1. (Optional) Enter in seconds your **Database Read Timeout**. By default, the setting is `3600` seconds or 60 minutes.

1. The following fields differ across patch versions of PAS v2.5, because v2.5.9 and earlier do not support apps running on cflinuxfs2 buildpacks, while v2.5.10 and later do.
	* **PAS v2.5.10 and later**:
		- Enter `X` to acknowledge that you have read the [Migrate Apps to cflinuxfs3](../upgrading/checklist.html#cflinuxfs3) section of the _Upgrade Preparation Checklist for PCF v2.5_.
		- Under **Do you want to install CFLinuxFS2?**, select **Yes** or **No**.
	* **PAS v2.5.9 and earlier**:
		- Enter `X` to acknowledge that there are no apps running on `cflinuxfs2` in your deployment.
		You can upgrade from PAS v2.4 to older patch versions of PAS v2.5 once there are no longer any apps running on `cflinuxfs2`.
		See the [Migrate Apps to cflinuxfs3](../upgrading/checklist.html#cflinuxfs3) section of the _Upgrade Preparation Checklist for PCF v2.5_.
