  See [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry](./backup-restore/index.html) for more information.

1. CF API Rate Limiting prevents API consumers from overwhelming the platform API servers. Limits are imposed on a per-user or per-client basis and reset on an hourly interval. 
	<br><br>
	To disable CF API Rate Limiting, select **Disable** under **Enable CF API Rate Limiting**. To enable CF API Rate Limiting, do the following:
	
	1. Under **Enable CF API Rate Limiting**, select **Enable**.
	1. For **General Limit**, enter the number of requests a user or client is allowed to make over an hour interval for all endpoints that do not have a custom limit. The default value is `2000`.
	1. For **Unauthenticated Limit**, enter the number of requests an unauthenticated client is allowed to make over an hour interval. The default value is `100`.

1. (Optional) Enter in seconds your **Database Connection Validation Timeout**. By default, the setting is `3600` seconds or 60 minutes. You can enter `-1` to cause Cloud Controller to make an additional query to the database whenever connections are checked out from the pool. Choosing `-1` has performance implications.

1. (Optional) Enter in seconds your **Database Read Timeout**. By default, the setting is `3600` seconds or 60 minutes.

1. (Optional) Select your default Linux stack. Apps pushed to Linux cells run on this stack unless you specify otherwise with the `cf push -s STACKNAME` option. Existing apps continue to use their current stack when you change the default stack. For more information, see [Restaging Applications on a New Stack](../devguide/deploy-apps/stacks.html#cli-commands). For a brief description of each option, see the following:
	* **Platform default (currently cflinuxfs2)**: Use the default stack for the current PCF version and migrate on upgrade if there is a new default stack. 
	* **cflinuxfs3**: Use `cflinuxfs3` and do not change on upgrade. 
	* **cflinuxfs2**: Use `cflinuxfs2` and do not change on upgrade.

1. Click **Save**.
