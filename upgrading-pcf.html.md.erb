<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Changes:</strong> Read the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/pcf-release-notes/index.html">Release Notes</a> and <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html">Breaking Changes</a> for this release, including the Known Issues sections, before starting the upgrade process.</p>

<p class="note warning"><b>Warning:</b> Pivotal does not recommend that you skip minor versions when upgrading PCF. Skipping minor versions when upgrading PCF may result in breaking changes. To avoid additional breaking changes, upgrade PCF to the minor version that directly follows your current version of PCF.</p>

The apps in your deployment continue to run during the upgrade. However, you cannot write to your deployment or make changes to apps during the upgrade.

For details about how upgrading PCF impacts individual PAS components, see [What Happens During PAS Upgrades](../upgrading/understanding-pas.html).

1. After confirming that the new installation functions correctly, remove the Ops Manager v2.3 VM.


## <a id="monitor"></a> Monitor Upgrade

During the upgrade, you can do the following to monitor your PCF foundation and help troubleshoot any issues.

###  <a id="status"></a> Check Status and Performance

**Note/Reason**: <br>
Monitor the progress of the upgrade, checking the status of the foundation at various locations.<br>
**Product/Component**:<br>
PCF

Pivotal recommends live-monitoring your upgrade with PCF Healthwatch, which monitors and alerts on the current health, performance, and capacity of PCF. Healthwatch captures, calculates, stores, visualizes, and alerts on PCF platform metrics, including:

- BOSH-reported VM metrics
- Runtime component metrics
- [Key Performance Indicators](../../monitoring/kpi.html) and [Key Scaling Indicators](../../monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html)
- Healthwatch-generated [super metrics](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/metrics.html)

For more information, see the [PCF Healthwatch documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/index.html).

If you are not using PCF Healthwatch, you can do some or all of the following to monitor upgrade progress:

* Run BOSH CLI status checks:
  * `bosh -e ALIAS task TASK_NUMBER`
  * `bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals, bosh -e ALIAS instances --ps`
* Check app availability
* Run cf CLI Commands
* Check the availability of the Ops Manager UI
* Check NAS performance (if using NAS)
* Check vSphere performance (if on vSphere)

### <a id="diego"></a> Check Diego State

**Note/Reason**:<br>
See the [cfdot documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cfdot) on GitHub for details.<br>
**Product/Component**:<br>
PAS

Use the CF Diego Operator Toolkit (cfdot) to check Diego component instance count by current state.

### <a id="storage"></a> (Optional) Take Snapshots of Storage Metrics

**Reason**:<br>
Pivotal recommends this if you have a large foundation and have experienced storage issues in the past.<br>
**Product/Component**:<br>
PCF

Periodically take snapshots of storage metrics.

###  <a id="collect-logs"></a> (Optional) Collect Logs

**Reason**:<br>
This information helps determine the cause of upgrade issues.<br>
**Product/Component**:<br>
PCF

If you encounter problems during upgrade, collect the following information:

* All job logs
* Task debug logs for VM upgrade tasks
* Installation log from Ops Manager


## <a id="after"></a> After Upgrade

After your upgrade, do the following to prepare for use of your new environment, check its health status, and clean up.

### <a id="bosh-alias"></a> Re-Create BOSH Alias

Re-create your alias using BOSH: `bosh alias-env ALIAS -e DIRECTOR_IP`

* **Reason**: To log in to BOSH after upgrading PCF, you need to re-create your alias.
* **Product/Component**: BOSH

### <a id="cf-cli"></a> Install New cf CLI

Download the version of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) packaged with the [PAS](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime/) tile on Pivotal Network.

### <a id="health"></a> Check the Health of Your Deployment

1. Run BOSH CLI commands to check system status:
  1. `bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME instances --ps`
  1. `bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals`
  1. `bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME cck --report`

    **Note/Reason**: To ensure that all jobs and process are running as expected<br>
    **Product/Component**: PCF and all tiles

1. Push and horizontally scale a test application.
  * **Reason**: This is a performance test for PAS.
  * **Product/Component**: PCF

1. If you are running PAS MySQL as a cluster, run the `mysql-diag` tool to validate health of the cluster.
  * **Reason**: See the BOSH CLI v2 instructions in the [Running mysql-diag](../mysql/mysql-diag.html) topic.
  * **Product/Component**: PAS

### <a id="resource-settings"></a> Check Resource Settings

If you added custom **VM Type** or **Persistent Disk Type** options, ensure that these values are correctly set and were not overwritten.

* **Note/Reason**: Verify that the Ops Manager **Resource Config** pane still lists your custom options.
* **Product/Component**: PCF

### <a id="bosh-cleanup"></a> Run BOSH Clean-Up

Run `bosh -e ALIAS clean-up --all` to clean up old stemcells, releases, orphaned disks, and other unused resources.
