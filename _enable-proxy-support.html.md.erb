(Optional) By default, Gorouter support for the PROXY protocol is disabled. To enable the PROXY protocol, select the **Enable support for PROXY protocol in CF Router** checkbox. When enabled, client-side load balancers that terminate TLS but do not support HTTP can pass along information from the originating client. Enabling this option may impact Gorouter performance. For more information about enabling the PROXY protocol in the Gorouter, see the _About HTTP Header Forwarding_ sections in the [Securing Traffic in <%= vars.product_runtime %>](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html) topic.
