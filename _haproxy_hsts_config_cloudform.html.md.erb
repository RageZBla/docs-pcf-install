If you want to force browsers to use HTTPS when making requests to HAProxy, select **Enable** in the **HAProxy support for HSTS field** and complete the following optional configuration steps:
	1. (Optional) Enter a **Max Age in Seconds** for the HSTS request. HAProxy forces HTTPS requests from browsers for the duration of this setting. The maximum age is one year, or 31536000 seconds.
	1. (Optional) Enable the **Include Subdomains** checkbox to force browsers to use HTTPS requests for all component subdomains.
	1. (Optional) Enable the **Enable Preload** checkbox to force instances of Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that access your HAProxy to refer to their built-in lists of known hosts that require HTTPS, of which HAProxy is one. This ensures that the first contact a browser has with your HAProxy is an HTTPS request, even if the browser has not yet received an HSTS header from HAProxy.
