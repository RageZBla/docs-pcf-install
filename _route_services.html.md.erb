In the **Choose whether or not to enable route services** section, choose either **Enable route services** or **Disable route services**. 
Route services are a class of [marketplace services](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#marketplace) that perform filtering or content transformation on application requests and responses. 
See the [Route Services](../services/route-services.html) topic for details. If route services are enabled, Bypass security checks for route service lookup may be selected. Enabling this has potential security concerns, but may be needed for backwards compatibility. See the _Route Service Internal Lookup Considerations_ section of the _Route Services_ topic for details.
