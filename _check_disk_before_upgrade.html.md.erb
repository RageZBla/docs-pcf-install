Confirm that you have adequate disk space for your upgrades. You need at least 20&nbsp;GB of free disk space to upgrade PCF Ops Manager and Pivotal Application Service. If you plan to upgrade other products, the amount of disk space required depends on how many tiles you plan to deploy to your upgraded PCF deployment. <br/><br/>
To check current persistent disk usage, select the <strong>BOSH Director</strong> tile from the **Installation Dashboard**. Select <strong>Status</strong> and review the value of the `PERS. DISK` column. If persistent disk usage is higher than 50%, select <strong>Settings > Resource Config</strong>, and increase your persistent disk space to handle the size of the resources. If you do not know how much disk space to allocate, set the value to at least `100&nbsp;GB`.
