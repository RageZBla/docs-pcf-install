In the **Smoke Tests** pane, you choose where to run smoke tests. The Smoke Tests errand runs basic functionality tests against your PAS deployment after an installation or update. In the **Errands** pane, you can choose whether or not to run the Smoke Tests errand.

To configure the **Smoke Tests** pane:

1. Select **Smoke Tests**.

1. If you have a shared apps domain, select **Temporary space within the system organization**, which creates a temporary space within the `system` org for running smoke tests and deletes the space afterwards. Otherwise, select **Specified org and space** and complete the fields to specify where you want to run smoke tests:
	* For **Organization**, enter the org you want PAS to use when running smoke tests.
	* For **Space**, enter the space you want PAS to use when running smoke tests.
	* For **Domain**, enter the domain you want PAS to use when running smoke tests.

1. Click **Save**.
