title: Deploying PAS with NSX-T Networking
owner: Ops Manager
---


This topic describes how to install Pivotal Application Service (PAS) on vSphere with NSX-T internal networking, using the VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for PCF.


## <a id='introduction'></a> Overview

PAS uses a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin to support secure and direct internal communication between containers. This plugin can be:

* The internal Silk plugin that comes packaged with PAS, or
* On vSphere, [VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/vmware-nsx-t), which installs as an Ops Manager tile.


## <a id='requirements'></a> Prerequisites

Before deploying PAS with NSX-T networking, you must have the following:

* An NSX-T environment with NSX-T components installed and configured. The NSX-T version must support the versions of NCP and PAS you intend to use. Verify the compatibility between NSX-T, NCP and PAS with the following documentation:
   * [Support Matrix: Pivotal PAS, VMware NSX-T, and VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for PCF](https://pas-nsx-t.cfapps.io/) for  supported version combinations.
   * [VMware NSX-T Data Center Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/). In particular, review the _NSX Container Plug-in (NCP) Release Notes_ and _NSX-T Data Center Installation Guide_ for the versions of NCP and NSX-T that you want to install.
* BOSH and Ops Manager installed and configured on vSphere. See [Deploying Ops Manager on vSphere](../om/vsphere/deploy.html) and [Configuring BOSH Director on vSphere](../om/vsphere/config.html).
* The [VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for PCF tile](https://network.pivotal.io/products/vmware-nsx-t) downloaded from Pivotal Network and imported to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**. See [Adding and Importing Products](./add-delete.html#add-import) for how to download and import Pivotal products to the **Installation Dashboard**.
* The [PAS tile](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime) downloaded from Pivotal Network and imported to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**. The PAS tile must be in one of the following two states:
  * Not deployed yet; you have not yet clicked **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** on this version of PAS.
  * Deployed previously, with the **Networking** pane > **Container Network Interface Plugin** set to **External**.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Deploying PAS with its Container Network Interface (CNI) set to **Silk** configures Diego cells to use an internally-managed container network. Subsequently switching the CNI interface to **External** NSX-T leads to errors.</p>

## <a id='architecture'></a> Architecture

The following diagram shows how to deploy an NSX-T machine to run PAS across multiple vSphere hardware clusters. NSX-T runs a Tier-0 (T0) router and multiple Tier-1 (T1) routers, each connecting to a network within Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Each vSphere hardware column cluster corresponds to an Availability Zone in PCF:

![NSX &amp; PAS Overview](nsx-t/nsx-t-refarch.png)

When a developer pushes an app to a new Org for the first time, the NSX-T plugin triggers NSX-T to create a new T1 router and allocate an address range for the Org, on demand.


## <a id='install'></a> Install and Configure PAS and NSX-T

Installing NSX-T to run with PAS requires the following actions, which are described below:

1. [Set up NSX-T to Integrate with PAS](#nsx-t-setup)

1. [Enable NSX-T Mode in the BOSH Director](#nsx-t-mode)

1. [Configure PAS for External Container Networking](#external-net)

1. [Install and Configure the NSX-T Tile](#nsx-t-tile)

### <a id='nsx-t-setup'></a> Set up NSX-T to Integrate with PAS

1.  In vSphere, create logical network switches to correspond to the networks that PCF uses.
  1. Log into the **NSX Manager Dashboard**.  
  1. Open the **Switching** tab.
  1. For each of these networks...
      - **Infrastructure** (BOSH and Ops Manager, defined in BOSH Director tile > **Assign AZs and Networks** pane)
      - **Deployment** (PAS, defined in PAS tile > **Assign AZs and Networks** pane)
      - **Services** and **Dynamic Services** (marketplace services and on-demand services, also defined in the PAS tile)
      - **Isolation Segment** (optional, defined in the Isolation Segment tile > **Assign AZs and Networks** pane)  
...do the following:
          1. Click **Add New Logical Switch**.
          1. Enter a name for the logical switch (e.g. `infrastructure-ls`, `deployment-ls`).
          1. Click **Save**.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-logical-switch.png)

1. Create T0 network address translation (NAT) rules to facilitate communication between Ops Manager and the BOSH Director.
  1. Create and configure a T0 router and router port for PCF.
  1. In NSX Manager, select your T0 Router and navigate to **Services** > **NAT**.
  1. Add a rule for destination NAT (DNAT) with:
      - The externally-specified destination IP address of incoming requests
      - The internal network address to translate the external address to
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-dnat-rule.png)
  1. Add a rule for source NAT (SNAT) with:
      - The range of internal addresses that outgoing traffic may come from
      - The external IP address to put in each outgoing packet header, indicating its source
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-snat-rule.png)

1. Create T1 Routers for PAS, to connect from the T0 router. For each PCF network, Infrastructure, Deployment, and so on, create a T1 router as follows: 
  1. In the NSX Manager UI, navigate to **Routing** > **Routers**
  1. Click **Add** > **Tier-1 Router**.
  1. Configure the router. For example, the Infrastructure network router configuration might look like:
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-t1-router.png)

1. Create T1 router ports for PAS. For each T1 router you created, add a **New Router Port** as follows, to to allow traffic in and out:
  1. In the NSX Manager UI, select the T1 router.
  1. In **Configuration** > **Router Ports**, add a new router port.
  1. For **Logical Switch**, enter the name of the logical switch you defined for the network in **Add New Logical Switch**, above.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-router-port.png)

1. Advertise the routes of the T1 routers to the T0 router, so the T0 router can correctly route incoming requests based on their destination IP address:
  1. Select your T1 Router and navigate to **Routing** > **Route Advertisement**.
  1. Under **Edit Route Advertisement Configuration**, enable route advertisement by setting **Status** to **Enabled**.
  1. Set **Advertise All NSX Connected Routes** to **Yes**.
  1. If you are using NSX-T Load Balancers to route traffic, set **Advertise All LB VIP Routes** and **Advertise All LB SNAT IP Routes** to **Yes**.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-route-advertise.png)

1. Allocate an IP Block for PAS Orgs.
  1. From NSX Manager, navigate to **DDI** > **IPAM** > **New IP block**.
  1. Enter a description, such as `This is where IP addresses come from when a new Org is created in PAS.`
  1. Enter a CIDR to allocate an address block large enough to accommodate all PAS apps.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-ip-block.png)
  - Add a tag to the newly-created IP block.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-t0-router.png)

1. Create a new switching profile with the following fields and tags:
  - **Name**: `ncp-ha`
  - **Type**: `Spoof Guard`
  - **Tags**: Add a tag with **Scope** `ncp/ha`, **Tag** `True`
  - **Tags**: Add a second tag with the **Scope** and **Tag** name of the T0 router tag you defined above.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-switching-profile.png)

1. Create an external SNAT IP pool.
  1. Navigate to **Inventory** > **Groups** > **IP Pools** > **New IP Pool**.
  1. Enter a name and a description.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-edit-ips.png)
  1. Add two tags to the SNAT IP pool.
![NSX ](nsx-t/nsx-t-external-ip-tags.png)

### <a id='nsx-t-mode'></a> Enable NSX-T Mode in the BOSH Director

1. From the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**, open the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. In the **vCenter Configs** pane, click the pencil icon for the vCenter Config you want to edit. Then select **NSX Networking**.
![Configure NSX-T mode in BOSH tile](NSXdirectorconfig.png)

1. Configure NSX networking by entering the following:
    * **NSX Mode**: Select **NSX-T**.
    * **NSX Address**: Enter the address of the NSX Manager.
    * **NSX Username**: Enter the username to connect to the NSX Manager.
    * **NSX Password**: The password for the username specified above.
    * **NSX CA Cert**: A CA certificate in PEM format that authenticates to the NSX server.
    If the NSX Manager generated a self-signed certificate, you can retrieve the CA certificate using OpenSSL with the command `openssl s_client -host NSX-ADDRESS -port 443 -prexit -showcerts`.

1. Open and configure the **NCP** (NSX-T Container Plugin) pane as follows:
  - **PAS Foundation Name**: The tag string you gave to the `t0 router` in NSX Manager, above.
  - **Overlay Transport Zone**: A uniquely identifying string for the **Transport Zone** that you chose when you [created logical switches](#nsx-t-setup) for each network. This can be the name of the transport zone if no other zones in NSX share the same name, or else the UUID for the transport zone.
  - **Tier-0 Router**: A uniquely identifying string for the T0 router. This can be the tag string that you gave the router in NSX Manager if no other T0 routers in NSX share the same name, or else the UUID for the router.
  - **Subnet Prefix of Container Networks**: Subnet mask to set the address range size for apps in a single org. Defaults to `24`. This number must be higher than the mask for all PAS orgs in the NSX Manager **New IP Block** pane, to define a each Org's fraction of the total PAS address space.
  - **Enable SNAT for Container Network**: Enable this checkbox.

1. Click **Save** and return to the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. After you have configured both the **PAS** tile and the **VMware NSX-T** tile, click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** to deploy PAS with NSX-T networking.

## <a id='upgrade'></a> Upgrade PAS with NSX-T Networking

After you have deployed PAS with NSX-T, you may need to upgrade either Ops Manager, PAS, the NSX-T Container Plug-in (NCP) or NSX-T Data Center. If you upgrade one of these components, you may need to upgrade the other components as well.

For example, if you want to upgrade NSX-T Data Center, you may need to upgrade the NSX-T Container Plug-in first.

To upgrade PAS with NSX-T Networking, do the following:

1. Plan the upgrade by determining the compatibility of NCP, NSX-T and PAS by checking the following documentation:
   * [Support Matrix: Pivotal PAS, VMware NSX-T, and VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for PCF](https://pas-nsx-t.cfapps.io/) for  supported version combinations.
   * [VMware NSX-T Data Center Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/). In particular, review the _NSX Container Plug-in (NCP) Release Notes_ and _NSX-T Data Center Installation Guide_ for the versions of NCP and NSX-T that you want to install.

1. Download the desired version of VMware NSX-T Container Plug-in for PCF tile from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/vmware-nsx-t).

1. If you are upgrading from NSX-T Container Plug-in v2.3 to NSX-T Container Plug-in v2.4, delete any manually created Switching Profiles before proceeding with the upgrade. In the NSX-T Manager interface, do the following:
    - Select **Networking**, **Switching**, **Switching Profiles**
    - Select **ncp-ha (for all clusters)**.
    - Click **Delete**.

1. In Ops Manager, import the new version of the tile to the **Installation Dashboard**. See [Adding and Importing Products](./add-delete.html#add-import) for directions.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes** and review your changes.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. Continue with the upgrade of Ops Manager, PAS or NSX-T Data Center.
