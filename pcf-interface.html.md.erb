This topic describes key features of the [Pivotal Cloud
Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Operations Manager
interface.


## <a id="installation-dashboard"></a> Installation Dashboard Page

The Installation Dashboard is the central Ops Manager interface for managing your PCF
deployment. It displays the BOSH Director configuration for your IaaS and product tiles
for your PCF deployment.

The following screenshot shows the Installation Dashboard. Each section is labeled with a
red letter. Click the image to see it at full size.
