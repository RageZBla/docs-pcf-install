Under **Certificates and Private Key for HAProxy and Router**, you must provide at least one **Certificate and Private Key** name and certificate keypair for HAProxy and Gorouter. The HAProxy and Gorouter are enabled to receive TLS communication by default. You can configure multiple certificates for HAProxy and Gorouter. 
   1. Click the **Add** button to add a name for the certificate chain and its private keypair. This certificate is the default used by Gorouter and HAProxy.

       You can either provide a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or click on the **Generate RSA Certificate** link to generate a self-signed certificate in Ops Manager.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you configured Ops Manager Front End without a certificate, you can use this new certificate to complete Ops Manager configuration. To configure your Ops Manager Front End certificate, see _Configure Front End_ in <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#config-frontend">Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on GCP Manually</a>.</p>
  1. If you want to configure multiple certificates for HAProxy and Gorouter, click the **Add** button and fill in the appropriate fields for each additional certificate key pair.
  For details about generating certificates in Ops Manager for your wildcard system domains, see the <a href="../opsguide/security_config.html#config">Providing a Certificate for Your SSL/TLS Termination Point</a> topic.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure that you add any certificates that you generate in this pane to your infrastructure load balancer.</p>
