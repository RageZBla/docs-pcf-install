Under **Certificates and Private Key for HAProxy and Router**, you must provide at least one **Certificate and Private Key** name and certificate key pair for HAProxy and the Gorouter. HAProxy and the Gorouter are enabled to receive TLS communication by default. You can configure multiple certificates for HAProxy and the Gorouter.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When providing custom certificates, enter them in the following order: <code>wildcard</code>, <code>Intermediate</code>, <code>CA</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/pem-ssl-creation.htm">Creating a .pem File for SSL Certificate Installations</a> in the DigiCert documentation.</p>
  1. Click **Add** to add a name for the certificate chain and its private key pair. This certificate is the default used by HAProxy and the Gorouter. You can either provide a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or click on the **Generate RSA Certificate** link to generate a certificate generated by the Ops Manager CA. For the values to use, see [Providing a Certificate for Your TLS Termination Point](../opsguide/security_config.html).
  	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you configured Ops Manager Front End without a certificate, you can use this new certificate to complete Ops Manager configuration. To configure your Ops Manager Front End certificate, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#config-frontend">Configure Front End</a> section in the <em>Preparing to Deploy Ops Manager on GCP Manually</em> topic.</p>
  1. If you want to configure multiple certificates for HAProxy and the Gorouter, click **Add** and fill in the appropriate fields for each additional certificate key pair. For details about generating certificates in Ops Manager for your wildcard system domains, see [Providing a Certificate for Your TLS Termination Point](../opsguide/security_config.html).
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that you add any certificates that you generate in this pane to your infrastructure load balancer.</p>
