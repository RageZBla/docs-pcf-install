Pivotal recommends that you minimize the use of master account credentials by 
creating an IAM role and instance profile with the minimum required EC2, VPC, 
and EBS credentials.

In addition, Pivotal recommends that you follow AWS account security best 
practices such as disabling root keys, using multi-factor authentication on the 
root account, and using CloudTrail for auditing API actions.

For more Amazon-specific best practices, refer to the following Amazon documentation:

* [IAM Roles Best Practices](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
* [AWS Security Best Practices Whitepaper](http://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-security-best-practices.pdf)
