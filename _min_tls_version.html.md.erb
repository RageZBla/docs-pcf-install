In the **Minimum version of TLS supported by HAProxy and Router** field, select the minimum version of TLS to use in HAProxy and Gorouter communications. HAProxy and the Gorouter use TLS v1.2 by default. If you need to accommodate clients that use an older version of TLS, select a lower minimum version. For a list of TLS ciphers supported by the Gorouter, see the [TLS Cipher Suite Support](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#ciphers) section of the _Securing Traffic into Cloud Foundry_ topic.
