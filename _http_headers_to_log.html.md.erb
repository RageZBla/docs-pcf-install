(Optional) If app developers in your organization want certain HTTP headers to appear in their app logs with information from the Gorouter, specify them in the **HTTP Headers to Log** field. For example, to support app developers that deploy Spring apps to PCF, you can enter [Spring-specific HTTP headers](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/HttpHeaders.html).
