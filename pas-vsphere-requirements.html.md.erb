The following are requirements for installing PAS that are specific to vSphere.

### <a id='pcf-deployment'></a> Minimum Resource Requirements for PCF Deployment with Pivotal Application Service

The following are the minimum resource requirements for maintaining a [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) deployment with Ops Manager and Pivotal Application Service (PAS) on vSphere:

* vSphere v6.7, v6.5, or v6.0
* Disk space: 2&nbsp;TB recommended
* Memory: 120&nbsp;GB
* Two public IP addresses: One for PAS and one for Ops Manager
* vCPU cores: 82
* Overall CPU: 28&nbsp;GHz
* vSphere editions: Enterprise Plus and above, as PAS requires Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)
* Ops Manager must have HTTPS access to vCenter and ESX hosts on TCP port 443.
* A configured vSphere cluster:
  * If you enable vSphere DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) for the cluster, you must set the Automation level to **Partially automated** or **Fully automated**. If you set the Automation level to **Manual**, the BOSH automated installation will fail with a `power_on_vm` error when BOSH attempts to create virtual machines (VMs).
  * Disable hardware virtualization if your vSphere hosts do not support VT-X/EPT. If you are unsure whether the VM hosts support VT-x/EPT, you should disable this setting. If you leave this setting enabled and the VM hosts do not support VT-x/EPT, then each VM requires manual intervention in vCenter to continue powering on without the Intel virtualized VT-x/EPT. Refer to the vCenter help topic at [Configuring Virtual Machines > Setting Virtual Processors and Memory > Set Advanced Processor Options](http://pubs.vmware.com/fusion-6/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.fusion.help.doc%2FGUID-38178690-1234-4843-B135-4063F9AA73E4.html) for more information.
* If you configure an external load balancer, an HTTP keep-alive connection timeout greater than five seconds 

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are deploying PCF behind a firewall, see the <a href="config_firewall.html">Preparing Your Firewall for Deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> topic.</p>

### <a id='small-footprint-deployment'></a> Minimum Resource Requirements for PCF Deployment with Small Footprint PAS

The following are the minimum resource requirements for maintaining a PCF deployment with Ops Manager and Small Footprint PAS on vSphere:

* 1 vSphere cluster/1 AZ
* 2 resource pools: 1 for NSX-T components and 1 for PAS or PKS
* 3 hosts minimum for vSphere HA (4 hosts for vSphere VSAN)
* Shared storage/VSAN
* 1 NSX Manager
* 3 NSX controllers
* 4 large edge VMs in a cluster
* PCF: Ops Manager, the BOSH Director, and Small Footprint PAS

### <a id='instance-number-scaling-reqs'></a> Instance Number and Scaling Requirements

By default, PAS deploys the number of VM instances required to run a highly available configuration of PCF. If you are deploying a test or sandbox PCF that does not require HA, then you can scale down the number of instances in your deployment. 

For information about the number of instances required to run a minimal, non-HA PCF deployment, see [Scaling PAS](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html).
