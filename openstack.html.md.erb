This guide describes how to install Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) on OpenStack with Ops Manager and Pivotal Application Service (PAS).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter. For guidance on OpenStack service credential management, see [Open Stack Security Documents](#security) below.

## <a id="security"></a> OpenStack Security Documents

These documents provide a general reference for OpenStack service credential management.

## <a id="requirements"></a> Requirements

This section describes the requirements for installing PCF on OpenStack, including general requirements for installing PCF with Ops Manager and PAS as well as OpenStack requirements. 

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: You can install PCF on OpenStack with the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) runtime. The Pivotal Container Service (PKS) runtime is not supported for OpenStack. For more information about PAS, see <a href="../concepts/index.html">PAS Concepts</a>. For more information about PKS, see the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/index.html">Pivotal Container Service (PKS)</a> documentation.</p>

### <a id="openstack"></a> OpenStack Requirements

The following are OpenStack requirements for deploying PCF: 

* PCF is supported on the OpenStack Ocata, Pike, Queens, Rocky, and Stein releases. OpenStack is a collection of inter-operable components and requires general OpenStack expertise to troubleshoot issues that may occur when installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry on particular releases and distributions. To verify that your OpenStack platform is compatible with PCF, use the OpenStack Validator tool. To access the OpenStack Validator tool, see [CF OpenStack Validator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-openstack-validator) on GitHub.

* Pivotal recommends granting complete access to the OpenStack logs to the operator managing the PCF installation process.

* For OpenStack accounts for PCF, Pivotal recommends following the principle of least privilege by scoping privileges to the most restrictive permissions possible for a given role.

* You must have a dedicated OpenStack project, formerly known as an OpenStack tenant.

* You must have Keystone access to the dedicated OpenStack project, including the following:
  * Auth URL
  * Username and password. The `PrimaryProject` for the user must be the project you want to use to deploy PCF. For more information, see [Manage projects and users](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/rocky/admin/manage-projects-and-users.html) in the OpenStack documentation. 
  * Project name
  * Region (with multiple availability zones if you require high availability)
  * SSL certificate for your wildcard domain (see below)

* You must have the ability to do the following in OpenStack:
  * Create and modify VM flavors
  * Enable DHCP if required
  * Create a network and then connect that network with a router to an external network
  * Create an external network with a pool of floating IP addresses
  * Boot VMs directly from image
  * Create two wildcard domains for separate system and app domains

* The following are resource requirements for the dedicated OpenStack project:
  * 118&nbsp;GB of RAM
  * 22 available instances
  * 16 small VMs (1 vCPU, 1024&nbsp;MB of RAM, 10&nbsp;GB of root disk)
  * 3 large VMs (4 vCPU, 16384&nbsp;MB of RAM, 10&nbsp;GB of root disk)
  * 3 extra-large VMs (8 vCPU, 16&nbsp;GB of RAM, 160&nbsp;GB of ephemeral disk)
  * 56 vCPUs
  * 1&nbsp;TB of storage
  * Nova or Neutron networking with floating IP support
  
      <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> By default, PAS deploys the number of VM instances required to run a highly available configuration of PCF. If you are deploying a test or sandbox PCF that does not require HA, then you can scale down the number of instances in your deployment. For information about the number of instances required to run a minimal, non-HA PCF deployment, see [Scaling PAS](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html).</p>

* The following are requirements for the OpenStack Cinder back-end:
  * PCF requires RAW root disk images. The Cinder back-end for your OpenStack project must support RAW.
  * Pivotal recommends that you use a Cinder back-end that supports snapshots. This is required for some BOSH functionalities.
  * Pivotal recommends enabling your Cinder back-end to delete block storage asynchronously. If this is not possible, it must be able to delete multiple 20&nbsp;GB volumes within 300 seconds.

* The following are requirements for using an Overlay Network with VXLAN or GRE Protocols:
  * If an overlay network is being used with VXLAN or GRE protocols, the MTU of the created VMs must be adjusted to the best practices recommended by the plugin vendor (if any).
  * DHCP must be enabled in the internal network for the MTU to be assigned to the VMs automatically.
  * Review the [Deploying PAS on OpenStack](./openstack-er-config.html#networking) topic to adjust your MTU values.
  * Failure to configure your overlay network correctly could cause Apps Manager to fail since applications will not be able to connect to the UAA.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using IPsec, your resource usage will increase by approximately 36 bytes. View the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html"> Installing IPsec topic</a> for information, including setting correct MTU values.</p>

## <a id='outputs'></a> Install PCF on OpenStack with PAS

To install PCF on OpenStack with the PAS runtime, do the following:

1. Delploy Ops Manager. See [Deploying Ops Manager on OpenStack](../om/openstack/setup.html).

1. Configure BOSH Director on OpenStack. See [Configuring BOSH Director on OpenStack](../om/openstack/config.html).

1. (Optional) Install the PCF IPSec add-on. See [(Optional) Installing the PCF IPsec Add-On](http://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html).

1. Configure PAS. See [Deploying PAS on OpenStack](./openstack-er-config.html).
