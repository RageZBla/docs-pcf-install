In **File Storage**, you determine where you want to place the file storage for your Cloud Controller.

To configure the **File Storage** pane:

1. Select **File Storage**.

1. To set the maximum number of recent valid packages that your app can store, not including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Max Valid Packages per App** field. Pivotal recommends leaving the default value of `5`. However, you can lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.

1. To set the maximum number of recent valid droplets that your app can store, not including the package for the current droplet, enter a value in the **Max Staged Droplets per App** field. Pivotal recommends leaving the default value of `5`. However, you can lower the value if you have strict storage requirements and want to use less disk space.
