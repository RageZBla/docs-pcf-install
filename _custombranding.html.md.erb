This section describes how to configure **Custom Branding** and **Apps Manager** to customize the appearance and
functionality of Apps Manager. For more information about the **Custom Branding**
configuration settings, see [Custom Branding Apps
Manager](../opsguide/custom-branding.html).

1. Select **Custom Branding**. The following image shows the **Custom Branding** page.
	![There is a heading at the top of the Custom Branding page that begins with the text, Customize colors, images, and text. There are several fields on the Custom Branding page. The first three fields are Company Name, Accent Name, and Main Logo. There is a Save button at the bottom of the page.](images/custombranding.png)

1. Click **Save** to save your settings in this section.

1. Select **Apps Manager**. The following image shows the **Configure Apps Manager** page.
	![There is a heading at the top of the Apps Manager page that says, Configure Apps Manager. There are several fields on the Apps Manager page. The first three fields are Enable Invitations, Dislpay Marketplace Service Plan Prices, and Supported currencies as JSON. There is a Save button at the bottom of the page.](images/config-apps-man.png)

1. Select **Enable Invitations** to enable invitations in Apps Manager. Space Managers can invite new users for a given space, Org Managers can invite new users for a given org, and Admins can invite new users across all orgs and spaces. See the [Inviting New Users](../console/console-roles.html#invite) section of the <em>Managing User Roles with Apps Manager</em> topic for more information.

1. Select **Display Marketplace Service Plan Prices** to display the prices for your services plans in the Marketplace.

1. Enter the **Supported currencies as JSON** to appear in the Marketplace. Use the format `{ "CURRENCY-CODE": "SYMBOL" }`. This defaults to `{ "usd": "$", "eur": "â‚¬" }`.

1. Use **Product Name**, **Marketplace Name**, and **Customize Sidebar Links** to configure page names and sidebar links in the **Apps Manager** and **Marketplace** pages.

1. The **Apps Manager Memory Usage (MB)** field sets the memory limit with which to deploy the Apps Manager app. Use this field to increase the memory limit if the app fails to start with an `out of memory` error.

1. The **Invitations Memory Usage (MB)** field sets the memory limit with which to deploy the Invitations app. Use this field to increase the memory limit if the app fails to start with an `out of memory` error.

1. The **Apps Manager Polling Interval** field provides a temporary fix if Apps Manager usage degrades Cloud Controller response times. In this case, you can use this field to reduce the load on the Cloud Controller and ensure Apps Manager remains available while you troubleshoot the Cloud Controller. Pivotal recommends that you do not keep this field modified as a long term fix because it can degrade Apps Manager performance. You can optionally do the following:	
	* Increase the polling interval above the default of `30` seconds. 
		<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you enter a value between <code>0</code> and <code>30</code>, the field is automatically set to <code>30</code>.</p>
	* Disable polling by entering `0`. This stops Apps Manager from refreshing data automatically, but users can update displayed data by reloading Apps Manager manually.

1. The **App Details Polling Interval** field provides an additional way to reduce the load on the Cloud Controller when the **Apps Manager Polling Interval** field is not sufficient. This field controls the rate at which Apps Manager polls for data when a user views the **Overview** page of an app. Pivotal recommends that you do not keep this field modified as a long term fix because it can degrade Apps Manager performance. You can optionally do the following:
	* Increase the polling interval above the default of `10` seconds. 
		<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you enter a value between <code>0</code> and <code>30</code>, the field is automatically set to <code>10</code>.</p>
	* Disable polling by entering `0`. This stops Apps Manager from refreshing data automatically, but users can update displayed data by reloading Apps Manager manually.

1. (Optional) For **Multi-Foundation Configuration (BETA)**, enter a JSON object to enable multi-foundation support for Apps Manager. Enabling multi-foundation support allows you to manage orgs, spaces, apps, and service instances from multiple PCF foundations from a single Apps Manager interface. For more information, see [Configuring Multi-Foundation Support in Apps Manager](../opsguide/configure-multi-foundation.html).
