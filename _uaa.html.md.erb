1. Select **UAA**. The following image shows the **UAA** page.

  ![There are several fields on the UAA page. The first three fields are Choose the location of your UAA database, Hostname, and TCP Port.](images/ert_uaa_external.png) 

1. Under **Choose the location of your UAA database** select one of the following:
  - **PAS database (configured on the Databases pane)**: Use the same database server that other PAS components use. This system database is configured in the **Databases** pane, and it can be either internal or external.
  - **Other external database** - Use a separate, dedicated database server for UAA.

    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning</strong>: Protect whichever database you use in your deployment with a password.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For GCP installations, Pivotal recommends using an external database on Google Cloud SQL.</p>

1. (Optional) If you selected **Other external database**, complete the fields as follows. Each field includes additional guidance for specific IaaSes and installation methods.    
  * For **Hostname**, enter the hostname of the database server. 
      * **AWS Terraform**: Enter the value of `rds_address` in your Terraform output. 
      * **GCP Terraform**: Enter the value of `sql_db_ip` from your Terraform output. 
  * For **TCP Port**, enter the port of the database server. 
      * **AWS Terraform**: Enter the value of `rds_port` in the Terraform output. 
      * **GCP and GCP Terraform**: Enter `3306`. 
  * For **Username**, specify a unique username that can access this specific database on the database server. 
      * **AWS Terraform**: Enter the value of `rds_username` from your Terraform output. 
      * **GCP Terraform**: Enter the value of `pas_sql_username` from your Terraform output. 
  * For **Password**, specify a password for the provided username. 
      * **AWS Terraform**: Enter the value of `rds_password` from your Terraform output. 
      * **GCP Terraform**: Enter the value of `pas_sql_password` from your Terraform output.
  * For **CA Certificate**, enter a certificate to use for encrypting traffic to and from the database.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The CA Certificate field only works if your external database hostname matches a name specified in the certificate. This is not true with GCP CloudSQL.</p>

1. (Optional) Under **JWT Issuer URI**, enter the URI that UAA uses as the issuer when generating tokens. 

1. Under **SAML Service Provider Credentials**, enter a certificate and private key to be used by UAA as a SAML Service Provider for signing outgoing SAML authentication requests. You can provide an existing certificate and private key from your trusted Certificate Authority or generate a certificate. The following domain must be associated with the certificate: `*.login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Pivotal Single Sign-On Service and Pivotal Spring Cloud Services tiles require the <code>*.login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</code>.</p>

1. If the private key specified under **Service Provider Credentials** is password-protected, enter the password under **SAML Service Provider Key Password**.

1. (Optional) To override the default value, enter a custom SAML Entity ID in the **SAML Entity ID Override** field. By default, the SAML Entity ID is `http://login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` where `YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is set in the **Domains** > **System Domain** field.

1. For **Signature Algorithm**, choose an algorithm from the dropdown to use for signed requests and assertions. The default value is `SHA256`.

1. (Optional) In the **Apps Manager Access Token Lifetime**, **Apps Manager Refresh Token Lifetime**, **Cloud Foundry CLI Access Token Lifetime**, and **Cloud Foundry CLI Refresh Token Lifetime** fields, change the lifetimes of tokens granted for Apps Manager and Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) login access and refresh. Most deployments use the defaults.

1. (Optional) In the **Global Login Session Max Timeout** and **Global Login Session Idle Timeout** fields, change the maximum number of seconds before a global login times out. These fields apply to the following:
  * **Default zone sessions**:  Sessions in Apps Manager, PCF Metrics, and other web UIs that use the UAA default zones
  * **Identity zone sessions**: Sessions in apps that use a UAA identity zone, such as a Single Sign-On service plan

1. (Optional) Customize the text prompts used for username and password from the cf CLI and Apps Manager login popup by entering values for **Customize Username Label (on login page)** and **Customize Password Label (on login page)**.

1. (Optional) The **Proxy IPs Regular Expression** field contains a pipe-delimited set of regular expressions that UAA considers to be reverse proxy IP addresses. UAA respects the `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers coming from IP addresses that match these regular expressions. To configure UAA to respond properly to Gorouter or HAProxy requests coming from a public IP address, append a regular expression or regular expressions to match the public IP address.
