If you are not using SSL encryption or if you are using self-signed certificates, select the **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment** checkbox. Enabling this checkbox also disables SSL verification for route services and disables mutual TLS app identity verification.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For production deployments, Pivotal does not recommend disabling SSL certificate verification.</p>
