(Optional) If you want to limit the number of app connections to the backend, enter a value in the **Max Connections Per Backend** field. You can use this field to prevent a poorly behaving app from all the connections and impacting other apps. <br/><br/>
    To choose a value for this field, review the peak concurrent connections received by instances of the most popular apps in your deployment. You can determine the number of concurrent connections for an app from the <code>httpStartStop</code> event metrics emitted for each app request. <br/>    
    If your deployment uses PCF Metrics, you can also obtain this peak concurrent connection information from [Network Metrics](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-metrics/using.html#network). The default value is `500`.
