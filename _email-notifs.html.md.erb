In the **Email Notifications** pane, you can enable end-user self-registration. PAS uses SMTP to send invitations and confirmations to Apps Manager users. If you do not need this service, leave this pane blank and disable the **Notifications** and **Notifications UI** errands in the **Errands** pane.

To configure the **Email Notifications** pane:

1. Select **Email Notifications**.

1. For **From Email**, enter the email address from which email notifications are sent.

1. For **SMTP Server Address**, enter the SMTP address of the server that sends emails.

1. For **SMTP Server Port**, enter the port of the SMTP server that sends email notifications.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For GCP, you must use port 2525. Ports 25 and 587 are not allowed on GCP Compute Engine.</p>

1. For **SMTP Server Credentials**, enter the username and password for the SMTP server that sends email notifications.

1. Enable the **SMTP Enable Automatic STARTTLS** checkbox if you want your SMTP server to automatically create a secure TLS connection when sending emails.

1. Verify your authentication requirements with your email administrator and use the **SMTP Authentication Mechanism** dropdown to select **None**, **Plain**, or **CRAMMD5**. If you have no SMTP authentication requirements, select **None**.

1. If you selected **CRAMMD5** as your authentication mechanism, enter a secret in the **SMTP CRAMMD5 secret** field. 

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not configure the SMTP settings using this form, the administrator must create orgs and users using the cf CLI. For more information, see <a href="../adminguide/cli-user-management.html">Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI</a>.</p>
